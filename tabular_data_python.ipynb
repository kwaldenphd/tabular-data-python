    "## Lab Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab covers various methods for reading structured data into Python using the `csv` and `openpyxl`. It also covers other types of delimiters and escape characters. The lab also overs writing data from Python to a structured data file.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lab, students will be able to:\n",
    "- Describe the structure and components of a `.csv` file\n",
    "- Read a `.csv` file into Python using the `csv` module and a `for` loop\n",
    "- Understand how to approach other types of delimited files\n",
    "- Understand how to work with escape characters when loading structured data\n",
    "- Understand how Python dictionaries work as a type of structured data\n",
    "- Write data from Python to a `.csv` file\n",
    "- Understand the basic of working with `.xlsx` files in Python\n",

    "# `.csv` data in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a `.csv` file? \n",
    "\n",
    "1. CSV stands for \"comma-separated values.\" CSV files are tabular data structures (i.e. a spreadsheet), stored in a plain-text format.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Python includes a built-in `csv` module that allows us to read in data from a `.csv` file (or other type of delimited plain-text file), as well as write data to a `.csv` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In `.csv` files, each line represents a row in the spreadsheet, and commas separate cells in each row (thus the file format name comma-separated values).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. At first glance, `.csv` files look similar to proprietary spreadsheet program file formats, such as files saved in Microsoft Excel or Apple Numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. However, file formats like `.xls` or `.xlsx` (Microsoft Excel) or `.numbers` (Apple Numbers) are NOT plain-text formats. Try to open these file types in a text editor and you'll quickly see the additional content and markup added by the spreadsheet program. More on this later.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. A few characteristics that distinguish `.csv` files (or other plain-text structured data formats) from proprietary spreadsheet file types:\n",
    "- Columns in a `.csv` file don't have a value type. Everything is a string.\n",
    "- Values in a `.csv` file don't have font or color formatting\n",
    "- `.csv` files only contain single worksheets\n",
    "- `.csv` files don't store formatting information like cell width/height\n",
    "- `.csv` files don't recognize merged cells or other kinds of special formatting (frozen or hidden rows/columns, embedded images, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Given these limitations, especially compared to the way we often interact with spreadsheet programs like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, what's the advantage of working with `.csv` files?\n",
    "\n",
    "8. One key advantage of `.csv` files is their simplicity. You can load or open a `.csv` file in a text editor and be able to quickly see the values in the file. \n",
    "\n",
    "9. When working with data in a programming environment, `.csv` files as a plain-text format simplify the process of loading structured data."
